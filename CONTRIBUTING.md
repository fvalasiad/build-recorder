By contributing to the project,
you agree to the license and copyright terms of this license
and release your contribution under these terms.


## Sign your contribution

Please use the sign-off line in your patch.
Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch
or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch.
The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify
the below (from [developercertificate.org](http://developercertificate.org/)):


```

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

	have the right to submit it under the open source license
	indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
	of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
	license and I have the right under that license to submit that
	work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part

	permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
	in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other

## How to contribute

Good Pull Requests
(which contain patches, improvements, or new features)
are always welcome!

Please ask first before embarking on any Pull Request,
otherwise you risk spending time working on something
that might not be merged into the project.

In general, every Pull Request should have one or more
associated Issues with it.
The Issue present the problem and are used to discuss solutions;
Pull Requests contain code and are used to discuss the implementation.

Please adhere to the coding conventions used
(name, indentation, etc.).
You can use the `indent(1)` settings
in the repository to automatically format your code.

Pull Requests should remain focused in scope
and avoid containing unrelated commits.
